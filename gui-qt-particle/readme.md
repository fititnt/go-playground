# Gui QT Particle
Source: https://github.com/go-qml/qml/tree/master/examples/particle

## Setup
Add package to your system, if need

    go get gopkg.in/qml.v0

Then just run on CLI. A new GUI will pop up with a gay hello world

   go run main.go 

Is possible to cross compile from linux to windows, but need a few more
depencies.
